It's an HTTP Tunnel, not Proxy or something else.. You need at least one Proxy,
Tunnel, Gateway to talk with server:

              +--------------------------------+
              |   +--------+      +--------+   |
  Client  		|		| tunnel |      | tunnel |   |      Gateway
  Proxy    <------+        +------+        +------->  Tunnel
  Tunnel      |   | client |      | server |   |      Proxy
              |   +--------+      +--------+   |
   (A)        +--------------------------------+       (B)

If (A) supports talking with CONNECT and (B) be capable of serving it, this can
be used to pass TCP streams (e.g SSL, SSH) Although traffic passed between
tunnel endpoints are not CONNECT packets. Actually you can change shape of data
(adding encryption, fake headers reformatting) in alterResponse() and
alteredRequest(). If the firewall you trying to bypass, has some limits on TCP
connections, you might want to change connection pool options too, otherwise
probably it's be better to turn it off totally.

Provide proper IP/Port in client.py and server.py according to your network
setup. run server.py in server and client.py on client end of tunnel.
