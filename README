It's an HTTP Tunnel, not Proxy or something else.. You need at least one Proxy,
Tunnel, Gateway to talk with server:

              +--------------------------------+
              |   +--------+      +--------+   |
  Client      |   | tunnel |      | tunnel |   |      Gateway
  Proxy    <------+        +------+        +------->  Tunnel
  Tunnel      |   | client |      | server |   |      Proxy
              |   +--------+      +--------+   |
   (A)        +--------------------------------+       (B)

If (A) supports talking with CONNECT and (B) is capable of serving it, this can
be used to pass TCP streams (e.g SSL, SSH) Although traffic passed between
tunnel endpoints are not CONNECT packets. Actually you can change shape of data
(adding encryption, authentication or fake headers reformatting) in
alterResponse() and alteredRequest(). If the firewall which you're trying to
bypass, has some limitations on TCP connections, you might want to change
connection pool options too, otherwise probably it is better to turn it off
utterly.

Provide proper arguments to `ashttpc` or `ashttps` according to your network
setup.
